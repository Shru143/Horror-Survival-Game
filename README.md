<h2 align="center">GAME OVERVIEW</h2>
<h3 align= "left"> Main character: </h3>

Max, the protagonist of our FPS zombie survival game. Max is a rugged and experienced survivor who has been living in a world overrun by zombies for several years. He is a skilled marksman, and his expertise with firearms is his strongest asset in the game. 
Max is a middle-aged man with a rough exterior, sporting a rugged beard and a scar on his left cheek. He wears a leather jacket, cargo pants, and boots, all showing signs of wear and tear from his constant battles with the undead. Max can equip various types of guns, including pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. 
The zombies in the survival land are the result of a viral outbreak that has swept across the world, turning the majority of the population into mindless, flesh-eating monsters. These zombies are fast and aggressive, and they will relentlessly pursue Max and other survivors.

<h5 align= "center">Equipment</h5>

Spray Bottle: 
Max's spray bottle contains a mixture of chemicals that can be used to temporarily blind and disorient zombies. When sprayed in their faces, the chemicals cause the zombies to stumble and become vulnerable to attack.

Night Vision Cam: 
Max's night vision cam is a device that allows him to see in low-light environments. This will be particularly useful when navigating dark areas or when zombies are lurking in the shadows. The night vision cam has a limited battery life, so Max will have to use it sparingly. 

Flashlight: 
Max grips his trusty flashlight, its beam casting a bright light on the dark and eerie surroundings as he explores the treacherous terrain. The flashlight is an essential tool in his arsenal, allowing him to see in the darkness and uncover hidden dangers lurking in the shadows.
